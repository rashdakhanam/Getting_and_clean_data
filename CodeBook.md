MEASUREMENTS

The following sensor signals were captured: three axial linear acceleration and three-axial angular velocity 

acceleration signals was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals - tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ
body linear acceleration and angular velocity - tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
magnitude of three-dimensional signals using Euclidean form - tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag
Frequency domain signals using Fast Fourier Transform - fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag
